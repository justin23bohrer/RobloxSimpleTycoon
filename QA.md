# SimpleTycoon QA

Manual test cases for Roblox Studio. Use **Play** for single-player cases and
**Test → Clients and Servers** (2 players) for multiplayer cases.

To inspect server state, switch the Studio view to **Server** (Test tab →
"Current: Client/Server" toggle) and look at `Players.<name>.leaderstats.Cookies`
and the `OwnerUserId` attribute on `Workspace.Map.Plots.PlotN`.

Status key: ✅ pass · ❌ fail · ⏳ not testable yet (feature is a stub).
Record the date and result when you run a case.

## Build

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| B1 | `mkdir -p build && rojo build default.project.json --output build/SimpleTycoon.rbxlx` | Builds with no errors or warnings. | |
| B2 | Start Play. Check Output. | No errors from ServerMain or services. No "missing" or plot-count warnings. | |

## Player

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| P1 | Player joins. | Player spawns on the grass at one of the four spawn areas; no errors in Output. | |
| P2 | Check the player list (with `DevUnlimitedCash = false`). | The column is named **Cookies** and shows **100**. | |

## Tycoon (claiming and unlocking)

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| T1 | Player joins; look at the plot. | Only the floor and a round blue pad with a "CLAIM TYCOON!" sign show. No sign, conveyor, collector, Collect pad, cash tank, buy buttons, or yellow spots. You can walk where they would be. `OwnerUserId` is not set. | |
| T2 | Look at the map (fly around in Studio). | Four 66 × 66 plots around the statue, all the same distance from it, each with its Claim pad and front doorway facing the statue, and an (invisible) spawn area between each plot and the statue; no blue spawn discs anywhere. All on grass; nothing overlaps. Output shows no `NumberOfTycoonPlots` warning. | |
| T3 | Player 2 steps on Player 1's Buy button / Collect pad. | Nothing happens to either player's cash or plot; button stays. | |
| T4 | Step on the Claim Tycoon pad. | Claim pad disappears. Sign shows "<DisplayName>'s Tycoon"; `OwnerUserId` = your UserId. Conveyor (not moving), collector, Collect pad ("COLLECT!", bouncing arrow), and the empty cash tank appear. Only **one** buy button appears: "Dropper 1 / FREE!", with yellow spot 1 above the conveyor. | |
| T5 | Stepping on your own Collect pad right after claiming. | Nothing happens (nothing stored). | |
| T6 | Press Play and check Output before anyone claims. | No warnings about a missing `ClaimPad` or other plot parts; no "no free plot" warning on join. | |

## Layout (66 × 66 plot)

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| LY1 | Press Play; walk from the spawn to the plot and around its edges. | The plot floor is 66 × 66 (2/3 the width and length of the old 100 × 100 one), starts just in front of the spawn, and the grass ground reaches past it on every side (no falling off the back). | |
| LY2 | Claim; stand at the front looking in. | Conveyor runs along the **left** side from front to back; collector in the back-left corner; cookie jar standing in the **middle** of the floor with the Collect pad on its front (spawn) side; owner sign at the front-right. The right half is empty. | |
| LY3 | Buy Dropper 1, then 2–4 (Server cash 4300). | Each button appears just right of the conveyor next to its yellow spot. Drops land on the conveyor and ride it **toward the back** into the collector (none fall off the sides); stored cash rises. | |
| LY4 | Collect at the cookie jar in the middle of the room. | The jar fills with small cookies as drops arrive at the collector; stepping on the Collect pad in front of it pays out as before. | |
| LY5 | Walk all the way around the cookie jar. | The only Collect pad is on the front (spawn) side. Behind and beside the jar there is nothing to step on that pays; the back is the plain back of the purple wall. Nothing overlaps the buy/build buttons, and you can walk between the jar and them. | |

## Statue

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| ST1 | Press Play; after spawning, turn the camera around (away from the plot). | A giant cartoon statue (~2 stories) on a stone pedestal stands behind the spawn, facing you, on the grass. | |
| ST2 | Look at the statue's face and outfit. | Big round head, shaggy dark-brown hair with fringe over the forehead and ears, big white eyes with tiny pupils, brows, small nose, wide grin with white teeth; dark navy long-sleeve shirt, gold chain, one hand on the hip; gray pants, white sneakers. A black cartoon outline around the whole statue. Nothing is floating or misaligned. | |
| ST3 | Walk into and jump on the statue/pedestal. | It's solid and doesn't move; nothing happens to cash or the plot. No errors in Output. | |
| ST4 | Walk around near the statue and look at it from the plot. | No noticeable lag. | |

## Feeding Caleb

Tip: set `DevUnlimitedCash = true` in Studio for the big-number cases (set it back before committing).

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| FD1 | Turn around at the spawn; walk around the statue. | Four round orange pads with "FEED CALEB!" signs: in front of, behind, and on both sides of the pedestal. | |
| FD2 | Step on any feed pad. | The pop-up appears with a little bounce: yellow rounded panel, thick dark outline, FredokaOne text: "How many cookies do you want to feed Caleb?", "Caleb has eaten 0 / 1,000,000", empty bar, "You have N", amount box, 10 / 100 / 1K / ALL, Cancel, FEED!. | |
| FD3 | Type `abc12x3` in the amount box. | Only digits stay: `123`. | |
| FD4 | With 100 cookies, press 10 → FEED!. | Cookies 100 → 90 (counter pops). The pop-up closes right away and a corner notification says "Caleb ate 10 cookies!". Caleb visibly gets a bit fatter (belly, cheeks, chin, wider body) with a bouncy grow. Step off and back on: progress "10 / 1,000,000  (0.00%)" with a thin sliver of bar. | |
| FD5 | Feed more than you have (e.g. type 5000 with 90). | "You don't have that many cookies!"; cookies unchanged; Caleb unchanged. | |
| FD6 | Press Cancel; then walk off and back onto the pad. | Cancel closes it. It doesn't reopen while you stand there, but reopens after stepping off and back on. | |
| FD7 | Open the pop-up, then walk ~15 studs away. | It closes by itself. | |
| FD8 | Press FEED! with the box empty. | "Type how many cookies first!"; nothing sent. | |
| FD9 | With dev cash, feed 10,000 then 1,000,000. | At 10,000 he's about two thirds as fat as the max. The second feed spends only 990,000 (the room left); he's at max size; signs say "CALEB IS FULL!"; the pop-up says "Caleb is FULL!". Further feeds: "Caleb is FULL!", no cookies spent. | |
| FD10 | 2 players: Player 1 feeds while Player 2 has the pop-up open. | Player 2's progress and bar update live; both see Caleb grow. | |
| FD11 | Security (code review / Server view): the client can't feed from far away or feed fractions/negatives. | `StatueService` rejects non-whole, < 1, and players not within `StatueFeedRange` of a pad; only `EconomyService.TrySpend` takes cookies. | |
| FD12 | Phone (Device emulator): open the pop-up. | Fits the screen, text readable, buttons tappable, keyboard opens for the amount box. | |
| FD13 | Reset character with the pop-up open; leave and rejoin the server. | Pop-up closes when you walk/teleport away; nothing breaks. Caleb's size stays for the server session (resets only on a new server). | |
| FD14 | Open the pop-up; click **1K** twice, then **10**. | Amount box reads 2010 (each click adds). Progress text shows "(+2,010)". | |
| FD15 | With Caleb at 0, click **1K** until the box says 100000. | The lighter preview section grows with each click and ends at exactly 1/10 of the bar; text "+100,000 = 10.0%". Clearing the box makes it slide back. | |
| FD16 | Pick more than you have (e.g. 1K with 50 cookies). | The preview section turns red. FEED! still says "You don't have that many cookies!" from the server. | |
| FD17 | Feed 500,000 cookies (dev cash), then reopen. | Bar is exactly half full; text "500,000 / 1,000,000  (50.0%)". The preview before feeding showed the same spot. | |
| FD19 | Feed any amount, then click FEED! twice fast on the next feed. | Each successful feed closes the pop-up immediately; it never stays open after a feed. It doesn't reopen until you step off the pad and back on. | |
| FD20 | Open the pop-up; pick a small amount (10), a medium one (100,000), and feed until the bar is full. Check up close and on a phone (Device emulator). | The cookie-colored fill and the lighter preview always stay inside the white track with a thin white gap; they never touch or cover the dark outline, and the rounded ends stay clean. | |
| FD18 | Join, walk straight from the spawn to Caleb, and step on each of the 4 feed pads (also after walking far away and coming back). | The pop-up opens every time you step on a pad, on all four pads. It doesn't reopen until you step off after closing it. | |

## Statue progress bar

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| SB1 | Press Play; look at Caleb from the spawn. | A yellow rounded panel with a thick dark outline floats above his head (clear of the hair): "Caleb: 0 / 1,000,000 🍪" in FredokaOne over an empty white bar. It looks like the feed pop-up's bar. | |
| SB2 | Walk to each plot (and inside a house) and look toward the statue. | The bar is visible and readable from every plot, drawn over roofs; it stays the same size on screen. | |
| SB3 | Feed 10 cookies. | Text "Caleb: 10 / 1,000,000 🍪"; a thin sliver of fill slides in; the panel pops. | |
| SB4 | Feed 500,000 (dev cash). | Text "Caleb: 500,010 / 1,000,000 🍪" (commas); bar just over half full. | |
| SB5 | Feed until 1,000,000. | Text "Caleb is FULL! 1,000,000 🍪"; bar completely full, fill stays inside the outline. As Caleb reaches max size the bar is still clear of his head. | |
| SB6 | 2 players: Player 1 feeds. | Player 2's bar updates at the same time, wherever Player 2 is. | |
| SB7 | 2 players: Player 1 feeds some cookies, then Player 2 joins (late joiner). | Player 2's bar shows the current total right away, not 0. | |
| SB8 | Reset character; phone (Device emulator). | The bar stays (no duplicate bars after respawn); readable on a phone. No errors in Output. | |

## Caleb Full Event (core)

Tip: set `DevCalebFastCycle = true` (and `DevUnlimitedCash = true`) in Studio for these; set both back to false before committing. With fast cycle the goal is 1,000 and the states last 3 s / 20 s / 30 s. Watch the statue's attributes (`CookiesEaten`, `CalebState`, `CalebCycleId`, `CalebStateEndsAt`, `CalebTopFeeders`) and each player's `CalebFed` / `CalebTrophyClaimed` in the Properties panel (server view).

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| CE1 | Fast cycle on. Press Play. | Statue: `CalebState = Normal`, `CalebMaxCookies = 1000`, `CookiesEaten = 0`, a GUID `CalebCycleId`, `CalebStateEndsAt = 0`, `CalebTopFeeders = []`. Player: `CalebFed = 0`, `CalebTrophyClaimed = false`. | |
| CE2 | Feed 100, then 50. | `CookiesEaten = 150`, your `CalebFed = 150`. Within ~1 s `CalebTopFeeders` lists you with 150 (one update for quick feeds in a row, never more than once a second, and the last value always shows up). | |
| CE3 | 2 players (Clients and Servers), both at 900 total: both feed 500 at the same moment. | The total ends at exactly 1,000. The first feed spends 100 (room left), the second is refused "Caleb is FULL!" with no cookies spent. Each player's `CalebFed` matches what they actually spent. | |
| CE4 | Reach the goal. | `CalebState` goes Full → (3 s) Celebration → (20 s) TrophyClaim → (30 s) Normal, each exactly once (no double jumps). `CalebStateEndsAt` is about now + the state's length. Pad signs say "CALEB IS FULL!" until reset. Caleb is hidden during TrophyClaim. | |
| CE5 | Try to feed during Full, Celebration, and TrophyClaim. | Refused "Caleb is FULL!"; no cookies spent; total stays at the goal. | |
| CE6 | Reach the goal only once; wait the whole event. | Only one event runs; nothing starts a second Full while one is running. | |
| CE7 | Player A feeds this cycle, leaves before TrophyClaim, rejoins the same server. | After rejoining, `CalebFed` is restored (same number) and `CalebTrophyClaimed` is unchanged; during TrophyClaim A is still eligible (`CalebCycle.IsEligible(A.UserId)`). | |
| CE8 | Player B joins after the goal is reached (during Full/Celebration/TrophyClaim). | B's `CalebFed = 0`; B is not eligible. | |
| CE9 | After the reset (back to Normal). | New `CalebCycleId`; `CookiesEaten = 0`; `CalebTopFeeders = []` right away; everyone's `CalebFed = 0` and `CalebTrophyClaimed = false`; Caleb visible at his smallest size; pads say "FEED CALEB!"; feeding works again and the next goal starts a new event. | |
| CE10 | Fast cycle off (normal). | Goal 1,000,000; Full 5 s, Celebration 115 s, TrophyClaim 300 s. `DevCalebFastCycle` has no effect in a published game. | |

## Purchase

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| U0 | Claim the plot. | Only "Dropper 1 / FREE!" is showing. | |
| U1 | Step on "Dropper 1 / FREE!" with 100 cookies. | Cookies stay **100**. Button 1 and yellow spot 1 disappear; an upside-down red cup appears at spot 1; the conveyor starts and drops fall every 2 s. The "Dropper 2 / 🍪 300" button and yellow spot 2 appear. Buttons 3 and 4 are still hidden. | |
| U2 | Can't afford: with 299 cookies (Server view), step on "Dropper 2". | Nothing bought; cash stays 299; button 2 stays. | |
| U3 | After buying, walk over where button 1 was (repeatedly). | No second dropper; no cash removed. | |
| U4 | Buy in order: set Server cash to 4300, buy Dropper 1, 2, 3, 4. | Cash 4300 → 4300 → 4000 → 3000 → 0. Each purchase hides that button and shows the next one; after Dropper 4 no buttons remain. A dropper appears at each spot. | |
| U5 | Order is enforced by the server: before buying Dropper 1, in **Server** view select `BuyButton2` and set `Transparency = 0`, `CanTouch = true`, then step on it with cash ≥ 300. | Nothing is bought; cash unchanged. (Only the next dropper can be bought.) | |
| U6 | Walk across the spots where the hidden buttons 2–4 are, before unlocking them. | Nothing happens; no cash removed. | |
| U7 | Can't buy twice: after buying Dropper 3, walk over where its button was, repeatedly (with cash ≥ 1000). | No cash removed; still one dropper at spot 3; the button stays hidden. | |

## Building and the 2nd floor

Tip: set `DevUnlimitedCash = true` (Studio only) so you can buy everything quickly.

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| BF1 | Claim; look at the right side of the plot. Buy Droppers 1–3. | No orange build button, no walls, stairs, or 2nd floor. You can walk straight off the plot on every side. | |
| BF2 | Buy Dropper 4. | One orange "Build Walls / 🍪 5000" button appears on the right side (x ≈ 16). No other new button. | |
| BF3 | Before buying the walls, in **Server** view make `BuildButton2` visible and touchable (`Transparency = 0`, `CanTouch = true`) and step on it with ≥ 8000 cookies. | Nothing is built; no cookies spent (Stairs needs Walls first). | |
| BF4 | Buy the walls. | Cookies −5000. Off-white brick walls with gray trim and dark windows appear around the plot with a gray-framed doorway in the middle of the front; the Build Walls button disappears; "Build Stairs / 🍪 8000" appears. You can walk in and out through the doorway only. The owner sign, conveyor, droppers, collect pad, and cookie jar still work inside. | |
| BF5 | Buy the stairs. | Cookies −8000. 16 cream steps appear along the right wall; "2nd Floor / 🍪 15000" appears. Walk up them: each step is climbable without jumping. The top reaches the top of the walls, and nothing is there yet (no floor). | |
| BF6 | Buy the 2nd floor. | Cookies −15000. A floor appears on top of the walls with a railing around the stair hole, plus the brick second story and the gray roof (see HS1). Walk up the stairs onto it. On the **left** side, directly above the first conveyor, is a second conveyor (not moving yet) and a green collector at its back end. "Dropper 5 / 🍪 20000" and its yellow spot appear next to it. Nothing on floor 1 is blocked or hidden by the new floor. | |
| BF7 | Buy Dropper 5. | A dropper appears at spot 5; cookies fall onto the 2nd-floor conveyor, which moves front → back (same as floor 1) into Collector2. Each arrival adds a small cookie to the cookie jar **downstairs**. Dropper 6's button appears. The floor-1 conveyor keeps running. | |
| BF8 | Go down and step on the Collect pad. | You get the cookies from both floors (e.g. with only Droppers 1 and 5 running: +10 per floor-1 cookie and +300 per floor-2 cookie). | |
| BF9 | Buy Droppers 6, 7, 8. | Each costs its price; each appears above Conveyor2; after Dropper 8 no buy buttons remain. | |
| BF10 | Try to fall: walk along every edge of the 2nd floor and around the stair hole. | The second-story walls and the hole railings stop you everywhere except at the top of the stairs. | |
| HS1 | With everything built, walk out the front doorway and look back at the house (also from each side and the back). | It looks like a two-story off-white brick house: gray corner posts, a gray band along the top of the first floor, dark windows with gray frames, grilles, and sills on every side (an arched one above the doorway and a wide one on the upper front), a gray shingle **hip roof** that slopes down on all four sides with a ridge on top and darker caps on the ridge and the four hips, eaves overhanging every wall with a light soffit and gray fascia underneath, a pointed brick front gable with gray trim and a round vent, and a brick chimney with a gray cap at the back. No roof face is missing, upside down, or has a gap. No parts flicker or poke through each other. | |
| HS2 | Walk inside both floors and around the stairs. | Windows also show (frame + dark glass) on the inside walls, except beside the stairs. You never snag on window frames, sills, or trim; the stairs still climb without jumping. Neither floor is too dark to play (note it if it is). | |
| HS3 | Before the walls are bought, and after leaving (plot reset). | None of the house shows: no walls, trim, windows, second story, or roof. | |
| CR1 | Buy Dropper 1; look at it closely, from the side and from below. | It's an upside-down red party cup (narrower at the top, darker ridges, rolled lip) with a white inside at the bottom opening. Cookies come out of the opening every 2 s and land on the belt. | |
| CR2 | Buy all 8 droppers (unlimited money). Watch both conveyors for a few minutes. | Gray guard rails line both sides of each conveyor and collector, with a stop at each conveyor's front end and behind each collector. No cookie falls off a conveyor; every cookie reaches its collector and adds a small cookie to the jar. Rails don't block the buy buttons or the stairs. | |
| CR3 | Leave (plot reset), or look before claiming / before buying the 2nd floor. | No cups remain; the rails show and hide together with their conveyor (floor-1 rails after claiming, floor-2 rails only after the 2nd floor is built). | |
| BF11 | Leave (or 2-player L1) after building the 2nd floor. | Walls, stairs, 2nd floor, both conveyors' droppers, and all buttons disappear; both conveyors stop; the plot looks like T1 again. The next owner starts from Dropper 1 with nothing built. | |

## Economy

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| E1 | In the **Client** view, change your `leaderstats.Cookies` value. Switch to **Server** view. | Server value is unchanged. Buying still uses the server value. | |
| E2 | Code review: search for writes to `Cash`. | Only `EconomyService` changes cash. | |
| E3 | Collection. | Payout equals the sum of the values of the drops that reached the collector, paid once. | |
| E4 | With only Dropper 1, let 3 drops reach the collector. | 3 small cookies in the cookie jar; no amount text anywhere; cash unchanged. | |
| E5 | Step on your own Collect pad after E4, then stand/jump on it. | Cash +30 exactly once; tank empties. | |
| E6 | Drop an unrelated part (e.g. from the Explorer in Server view) onto a collector. | No cookie added to the jar; stored cash unchanged. | |

## Dropper

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| D1 | After buying, watch the dropper. | One drop about every 2 seconds. | |
| D2 | Watch a drop. | It rides the conveyor into the collector. | |
| D3 | Drops that fall off. | They are removed after `DropLifetime` seconds. | |
| D4 | Buy all four droppers; watch the collector. | Each dropper drops every 2 s onto the one conveyor; conveyor keeps moving; stored cash rises by 10/25/60/150 per drop from droppers 1/2/3/4. | |

## Cookies

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| CK1 | Buy Dropper 1 and watch the drops. | Each drop is a flat golden-brown cookie with dark chocolate chips on top, lying flat. It rides the conveyor into the collector, and each one that arrives adds a small cookie to the jar. | |
| CK2 | Watch cookies arrive at the collector for a while. | No cookie gets stuck on the collector (the chips never block a claim); none pile up there. | |

## Dev cash (Studio only)

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| DV1 | Set `DevUnlimitedCash = true` in `Config.luau`, Play in Studio. | Output shows one "[DEV] Unlimited cash is ON ... 1000000000 cookies" line; Cookies shows 1000000000. Buying a dropper subtracts its cost (Dropper 1 is free). | |
| DV2 | Set `DevUnlimitedCash = false`, Play. | No "[DEV]" line; cash shows 100. | |
| DV3 | Code review: dev cash is gated by `RunService:IsStudio()` in `PlayerDataService`, and `DevUnlimitedCash` is `false` in the committed `Config.luau`. | Both true. | |

## Visuals

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| V1 | Look at the Claim pad; then claim and look at the Buy button and Collect pad. | Each is a flat circle lying on the ground with a darker ring around its edge; labels float readably above the pads. | |
| CT1 | Look behind the Collect pad. | Purple wall with a gold frame, cartoony "COOKIE JAR" sign (see V6) readable from the pad side, glass tank on an orange stand. The wall doesn't block walking onto the pad. | |
| CT2 | Look above the pad. | A gold ▼ arrow bounces up and down, always. | |
| CT3 | Buy Dropper 1; watch a drop reach the collector. | One small cookie falls into the jar per drop; pad starts sparkling and glowing. | |
| CT4 | Buy several droppers; let 60+ drops arrive. | Tank fills, stops at about 60 small cookies, nothing spills out; collecting still pays the full stored amount. | |
| CT5 | Step on the pad with small cookies in the tank. | Gold sparkle burst; tank empties; sparkles/glow stop until the next drop. | |
| CT6 | In a 2-player test, Player 2 watches Player 1's tank fill and empty. | Player 2 sees the same small cookies, sparkles, and burst. | |
| CT7 | Try to jump into the tank. | The glass lid and walls keep you out; the small cookies don't pay anything if touched. | |
| V2 | Walk across the rings only (not the pad centers). | Nothing is bought or collected; only touching the pad itself does. | |
| V5 | Claim the plot; look at the owner sign at the front-right from the spawn side, then from inside the plot, in daylight and at night. | The name is on the wall itself (not floating): a purple rounded panel with a thick dark outline inside a gold frame, white chunky text with a dark outline reading "<DisplayName>'s Tycoon", on both sides. Not darkened at night. In Studio the name is your Studio test name (e.g. "Player1"). After leaving and a new claim, it shows the new owner's name. | |
| V3 | Look at the signs above the Claim pad, then (after claiming) the buy button and Collect pad. Check from close up and ~40 studs away, in daylight and at night (Lighting `ClockTime = 0`). | Each sign is a bright rounded panel with a thick dark outline and white chunky text (same font as the cash display) with a dark outline: blue "CLAIM TYCOON!", red "Dropper N" with the price in yellow underneath (e.g. "🍪 300"; "FREE!" for Dropper 1; the cookie emoji renders, not a box), green "COLLECT!". Text stays inside the panel; no raw tags like `<font>` show; colors are not darkened at night; the Collect sign doesn't overlap the bouncing arrow. | |
| V4 | Look around the map from the spawn and from the plot. | All ground outside the plot is green grass (grass texture up close). The plot's gray floor, pads, conveyor, and cookie jar look the same as before. | |
| V6 | Claim the plot; stand on the Collect pad and look up at the "COOKIE JAR" sign, then from ~30 studs away, in daylight and at night (Lighting `ClockTime = 0`). Repeat on Plots 2–4. | The sign matches the other cartoony signs: a pink rounded panel with a thick dark outline inside a thin gold frame, white chunky "COOKIE JAR" text with a dark outline, centered with space around it (not touching the edges, not squashed or stretched). It faces the Collect pad (front); the back of the jar wall shows no text. Not darkened at night. The glass lid doesn't cover it. | |

## Cookie display (client UI)

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| C1 | Player joins. | A yellow rounded panel with a thick dark outline, a round golden-brown cookie with 4 dark chips, and white "100" (no "$") appears at the bottom-center. The player list (top right) still shows Cookies 100. No errors in Output. | |
| C2 | Claim, buy Dropper 1, then collect (or in **Server** view set `leaderstats.Cookies` to 1250, then 1234567). | Text updates right away and matches the player list: e.g. "130", "1,250", "1,234,567". The panel does a quick bounce each time. | |
| C3 | Test → Device emulator: a phone (e.g. iPhone SE, landscape) and a large PC resolution. | Panel stays centered at the bottom, keeps its shape, text is readable and inside the panel, and it does not cover the thumbstick or jump button. | |
| C4 | Reset character (Esc → Reset). | Only one cash panel; it still shows the correct amount and still updates. | |

## Multiplayer (2 players)

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| M1 | Two players join; Player 1 steps on the Claim pad, then Player 2 walks to where it was. | Player 1 gets the plot (sign shows their name). The Claim pad is gone, so Player 2 cannot claim; Player 2 has no plot. No warnings in Output. | |
| M2 | Player 2 steps on Player 1's Collect pad. | Player 2 gets nothing; Player 1's jar cookies and stored cash are unchanged. | |
| M3 | Player 2 steps on Player 1's Buy button (the one showing). | Nothing happens; Player 2's cash stays 100; the button stays. |
| M4 | Both players step on the Claim pad at the same moment. | Exactly one of them owns the plot; the other has none. | |
| M5 | Four players (Test > Clients and Servers, 4 players). Each claims a different plot. | Each player owns exactly one plot; each sign shows its owner's name. A player who already owns a plot can't claim a second one. | |
| M6 | With 4 players, each buys Dropper 1 and collects. | Each plot's cup drops cookies onto its own conveyor, into its own collector and cookie jar; collecting pays only that plot's owner. Cookies on the turned plots (2–4) ride toward their own back-left collector and land inside their jar (not stuck in the glass). | |
| M7 | Join several times. | You appear at one of the four spawn areas (it varies). | |
| M8 | Player on Plot3 leaves. | Only Plot3 resets to its Claim pad; the other three keep running. | |

| SP1 | Test > Clients and Servers with 4 players (rejoin a few times if needed so all four spawns get used). | Every player appears standing on the grass between a plot and the statue, in front of that plot's doorway: at Plot1 (0, 0), Plot2 (−44, 44), Plot3 (0, 88), Plot4 (44, 44). Nobody falls through the ground, sinks into it, or gets stuck. | |
| SP2 | Fly around each of the four spawn spots in Studio (Play and Run mode). | Nothing blue and no disc, ring, decal, or outline is visible at any spawn; it's just grass. In Explorer, `Map` has `SpawnLocation`–`SpawnLocation4` and none has a `SpawnLocationRing` child. | |

## Respawn

| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| R1 | Reset character (Esc → Reset). | Cash unchanged (not reset to 100, not doubled). Same plot. | |
| R2 | Reset after buying a dropper. | Same droppers as before; nothing bought again; no extra cash. | |

## Leaving

| ID | Test | Expected | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| L1 | In a 2-player test, after Player 1 buys some droppers, close Player 1's window. | The plot goes back to the T1 look: only the floor and the Claim Tycoon pad; droppers, drops, buttons, sign, and collect area are gone; `OwnerUserId` removed. | |
| L2 | Leave after buying some droppers. | All droppers stop, drops are removed, conveyor stops, stored cash is cleared; cash tank empty, pad sparkles/glow off. | |
| L3 | After L1, Player 2 (already in the game) steps on the Claim pad. | Player 2 gets the plot and sees exactly the T4 look: collect area and only "Dropper 1 / FREE!" (nothing left over from Player 1). | |
